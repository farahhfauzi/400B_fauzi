Questions

1. Close encounters MW and M31
    - three times
 
2. Time and separation and velocity relationship
    - separation is exponentially decay over time
    - velocity peaks before the galaxies merges
    
3. When do MW and M31 merge?
    - around 6.8 Gyr
    - exponentially decay but still orbiting around both M31 and MW
    
4. Decay rate 
    - constant decay rate
    - 16 Gyr, probably about 4 Gyr after if it is at a distance 75kpc
